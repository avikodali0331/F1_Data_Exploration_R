# F1_Data_Exploration_R
An analysis of F1 data using R, covering things like pit stop data, points over season progression, etc.  

This project was done for my Data Wrangling and Management With R course at Rutgers University for my final project. The goal was to find data from two distinct sources and do analysis in order to demonstrate the skills and techniques I learned from the course. Since one of my biggest passions is F1, I decided to focus my project on that. I brought in data from the Ergast API, which has various data about F1, as well as some F1 related Twitter data from Kaggle. Along with the code and data for this project, I have also included the final knitted PDF report in this repository.
